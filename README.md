# Exp - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To draw the UML diagram for Student Course Enrollment System.

# SRS (Procedure):



1. **Use Case Diagram** – Shows main users (Student, Faculty, Admin) and system actions like *Enroll Course*, *Drop Course*, *View Schedule*, *Approve Enrollment*.

2. **Class Diagram** – Displays classes such as *Student, Faculty, Course, Enrollment* with attributes (e.g., *studentID, courseCode*) and relationships between them.

3. **Activity Diagram** – Explains workflow steps for processes like *Course Enrollment, Course Approval, Course Withdrawal*.

4. **Sequence Diagram** – Shows the step-by-step interaction between objects during actions like *Student Enrollment*.

5. **Communication Diagram** – Focuses on how system components (Student, Enrollment Module, Course Database, Admin) communicate during enrollment.

6. **Package Diagram** – Groups the system into modules such as *User Management, Course Management, Enrollment Module,* and *Schedule System*.
